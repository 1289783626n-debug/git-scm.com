  <h2 class="f4">Mailing list</h2>

  <p>
    Questions or comments for the Git community can be sent to the mailing list by using the email address <a href="mailto:git@vger.kernel.org" class="link blue hover-u">git@vger.kernel.org</a>. <strong>Bug reports for git should be sent to this mailing list.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not need to subscribe: you will be Cc&apos;d in replies. Please keep the Cc list intact when replying (use &quot;Reply to all&quot;). Greylisting may delay your first post for a few hours.  Note also that the list only accepts plain-text email; please disable HTML in your outgoing messages.
  </p>

  <p>
  By subscribing (click <a href="mailto:majordomo@vger.kernel.org?body=subscribe git" class="link blue hover-u">here</a>), you can make sure you're not missing follow-up discussions and you can also learn about other development in the community.  The list <a href="https://public-inbox.org/git" class="link blue hover-u">archive</a> can be found on public-inbox.
  </p>

  <p>
  Windows-specific questions can also be sent to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-for-windows" class="link blue hover-u">Git for Windows mailing list</a> (if in doubt whether your question is Windows-specific, just use the general Git mailing list). Please submit Windows-specific bugs to <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues" class="link blue hover-u">Git for Windows' bug tracker</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  There is also <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-users" class="link blue hover-u">Git user mailing list</a> on Google Groups which is a nice place for beginners to ask about anything.
  If you're a downstream packager of Git, consider joining the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/git-packagers" class="link blue hover-u">Git packagers mailing list</a> for low-volume announcements from the developers, as well as other discussion related to packaging &amp; porting Git.
  </p>

  <h2 class="f4">Bug reporting</h2>

  <p>
    Bugs in git can be reported directly to the mailing list (see above for
    details). Note that you do not need to subscribe to the list to send
    to it. You can help us out by attempting to reproduce the bug in the latest
    released version of git, or if you're willing to build git from source, the
    <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/next" class="link blue hover-u"><code>next</code> branch</a>.
    Sometimes an attempted fix may be pending in this branch, in which case
    your feedback as to whether the fix worked for you will be appreciated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bugs related to this website can be reported at its

                                                href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html" class="link blue hover-u">this

  <h2 class="f4">Reporting security issues</h2>

  <p>
    Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to
    the <a href="mailto:git-security@googlegroups.com" class="blue link hover-u">Git Security</a> mailing list.
  </p>

  <h2 class="f4">IRC channel</h2>

  <p>
    If the manpages and this book arenâ€™t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <span class="highlight fixed">#git</span> channel on the Freenode IRC server (<strong>irc.freenode.net</strong>). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.
    The <span class="highlight fixed">#git-devel</span> channel welcomes Git development discussion, and might be able to help you contribute to Git.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need specific help about one of the for-profit Git hosting sites, you might try their own IRC channels (such as <span class="highlight fixed">#github</span> or <span class="highlight fixed">#gitlab</span>) on the same IRC server.
  </p>

  <h2 class="f4">Contributing to Git</h2>

  <p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation" class="blue link hover-u">Documentation directory</a> in the Git source code has several files of interest to developers who are looking to help contribute. After reading the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines" class="blue link hover-u">coding guidelines</a>, you can learn <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches" class="blue link hover-u">how to submit patches</a>. For those looking to get more deeply involved, there is a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt" class="blue link hover-u">howto for Git maintainers</a>.
